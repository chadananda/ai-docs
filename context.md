# `ai_docs` - Technical Requirements

## Overview
`ai_docs` is an npm module designed to facilitate up-to-date code suggestions from AI models by generating machine-readable documentation for JavaScript libraries. It targets the problem where AI models, like GPT-4, might suggest outdated or incorrect code due to training cut-offs. The module offers a two-tiered lookup: Library Overview for a broad understanding, and Function Detail for granular information.

## Features

### 1. Automatic Version Detection
- Parse `package.json` to extract library versions.
- Identify libraries needing updated documentation by comparing with `_ai-docs`.

### 2. Documentation Fetching
For unmatched libraries, fetch:
- **Library Overview (Tier 1)**:
  - Purpose/Introduction
  - Sample Usage
  - Function List
  - Dependencies/Related Libraries
- **Function Detail (Tier 2)**:
  - Function Signature
  - Detailed Explanation
  - Sample Usage
  - Alternatives or Related Functions

### 3. GPT-4 Integration for Documentation Processing
- Process documentation through GPT-4 to produce machine-readable content.
- Output `overview.json` for each library and individual JSON files within a `functions` directory for function details.

### 4. Structured Local Storage
- Store in `_ai-docs/<library_name>/`.
  - `overview.json` for library overviews.
  - `functions` directory for function-specific details.

### 5. In-Memory Index Creation
- Produce an index, e.g., `functions.json`, mapping libraries to their overviews and functions/methods to their detailed documentation.

### 6. Command-Line Interface
- CLI to initiate or update the documentation process.

### 7. Error Handling and Logging
- Robust error handling for issues like failed fetching.
- Detailed logging throughout the process.

### 8. Testing
- Test core functionalities and on varied projects for compatibility.

### 9. Packaging
- Package for npm, ensuring easy integration for developers.

## Usage

1. Install the module:
   ```npm install ai_docs --save-dev```

2. Add to `package.json` scripts:
   ```"scripts": { "generate-docs": "ai_docs" }```

3. To run:
   ```npm run generate-docs```

## Benefits
- Enables AI models to stay updated with the latest library versions.
- Increases code suggestion accuracy by offering both high-level and detailed context.
